# TranSlander

A fully offline voice typing app for Android. Speak into your phone and text appears in any app — no internet required, no cloud processing, your voice data never leaves your device.

> **Note:** This started as a fun project. I really hate typing on touch screens and I hate voice messages even more. Then I got to know Parakeet and found it quite handy. As I am not an Android developer, I played around with Claude Code and came to the point where I thought it might be useful for others as well. So here we are.

## Features

### Offline Speech Recognition
- Uses [Parakeet TDT v3](https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8) neural model (~600MB) running locally via [sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx)
- Supports 25 languages with auto-detection
- No internet connection needed after model download
- **Import from folder** — load model files from local storage instead of downloading

### Works in Any App
- Uses Android Accessibility API to inject text directly into any focused text field
- Falls back to clipboard if no text field is focused

### Multiple Input Methods
- **Accessibility Button** — System navigation bar button, works system-wide
- **Floating Mic Button** — Draggable overlay, always visible (optional)
- **Keyboard Mic Button** — Integrates with keyboards like HeliBoard

### Voice Message Transcription
- **Share** audio files from any app
- **Open with** audio files from file managers
- **Folder monitoring** — Watch Downloads or custom folders for new voice messages
- Automatic notifications when voice messages are detected
- Supports OPUS, AAC, OGG, M4A, MP3, WAV formats

**Example: Signal voice messages**
1. Open Translander Settings → Voice Message Transcription
2. Add watch folder: `Music/Signal` (where Signal saves voice messages)
3. Enable "Monitor Folders"
4. In Signal, long-press a voice message → Save
5. Transcription popup appears automatically

### Word Corrections
- Custom dictionary to fix recurring recognition errors
- Example: "Tamtam" → "Tamdam"
- Whole-word matching with case-insensitive option
- Manage rules easily in Settings

### Microphone Recording History
- **Off by default** — Settings → Microphone → Keep microphone audio
- Retention options: **No history, 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, Forever**
- Only microphone recordings are saved; shared/opened audio is not duplicated
- Browse, play, share, delete, and retranscribe saved recordings from Settings
- Audio is private, offline PCM16 WAV (~115 MB/hour), split into hourly parts for long sessions
- Expired recordings are pruned automatically. Android can defer scheduled deletion while asleep; active readers/recordings are protected
- An interrupted recording can be recovered from its saved audio after restarting the app

### Long Audio and Incremental Results
- Files are decoded, downmixed, and resampled incrementally instead of loaded completely into memory
- Parakeet v3 runs through bounded offline windows with boundary context: **at most 12 seconds per inference call**
- Microphone recognition runs while capture continues; the IME and accessibility/floating input emit completed text segments
- File transcription shows completed text before the whole file has finished, with cancellation, bounded preview pages, Copy, and full text-file Share
- Single-result activity/API and clipboard transfers have a safe size limit; Settings → Recover transcript provides text-file export when delivery fails
- With No history, microphone audio stays in bounded memory queues and no audio file is created. If recognition cannot keep up, capture stops visibly and accepted audio finishes processing
- With history enabled, the saved recording also serves as the disk-backed audio backlog. History writing uses a separate bounded worker; a write failure warns and falls back to the bounded live queue

Parakeet v3 here uses **simulated streaming** over the existing offline ONNX model, not a native online model. Results arrive in segments rather than individual keystrokes; timing depends on pauses and device speed. Chunked recognition can differ from whole-utterance recognition near boundaries.

### Modern UI
- Material 3 design with Jetpack Compose
- Dark and Light theme support
- System theme auto-detection

### Keyboard Integration
Translander provides three APIs for voice input integration:

| Component | API | Use Case |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| `VoiceInputMethodService` | InputMethodService (voice IME) | Keyboard mic buttons (HeliBoard) |
| `SpeechRecognitionService` | RecognitionService | Apps using SpeechRecognizer class |
| `VoiceInputActivity` | RECOGNIZE_SPEECH intent | Apps launching voice input via intent |

**Setup for keyboard mic button (HeliBoard):**
1. Open Translander → Keyboard Integration → Tap "Voice Input Method"
2. Enable "Translander" in the system keyboard list
3. In HeliBoard settings, enable "Voice input key"
4. Mic button should now appear on keyboard toolbar

## Disclaimer

This app is provided as-is for personal use. Speech recognition accuracy depends on audio quality, accent, and background noise.

**Model Attribution:** Speech recognition uses [NVIDIA Parakeet TDT](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3), licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). ONNX conversion by [csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx).

**Privacy:** All speech processing happens locally on your device. No audio data is ever sent to any server. You can [download the model](https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8) directly or import it from a local folder, then revoke the Network permission in Android Settings to ensure the app can never access the internet.
