# Utterlane - Project Context

Maintainer: Stephen Karl Larroque <LRQ3000@GMAIL.COM>.
Project: https://github.com/lrq3000/Utterlane.
This independently maintained fork has a separate Android application identity.
See README.md for lineage and CONTRIBUTING.md for human sanity checking of AI
contributions. Original/derived artwork is documented in docs/design/.

## Mandatory: Read and Apply the Core Values

Before starting any task, agents **must read [CORE_VALUES.md](CORE_VALUES.md) in
full and apply it** when planning, implementing, reviewing, and verifying changes.
It is the shared guide for human contributors and AI agents to Utterlane's future
direction, covering product decisions, architecture, UI/UX, and optimization.

- Treat the values as requirements that guide decisions, not optional background
  reading. Apply their intent beyond the listed examples; the examples are not an
  exhaustive checklist or a claim that every behavior is already implemented.
- Evaluate changes against the complete user workflow and the relevant values.
  Protect user input, correctness, privacy, and recoverability when values compete;
  prefer removing redundant work to removing information.
- Explain material trade-offs or conflicts with these values when proposing or
  reviewing a change, and seek an approach that preserves them. Existing behavior
  is not a reason to perpetuate a conflict with the intended direction.

## What Is This App?

An Android voice typing app that works **completely offline**. Speak into your phone and text appears in any app - no internet, no cloud, no data leaving your device.

### Features
- **Offline speech recognition** - Uses Parakeet v3 neural model (~600MB) running locally via sherpa-onnx
- **Works in any app** - Uses Android Accessibility to inject text into any focused text field
- **Two input methods**:
  - Accessibility button (system nav bar) - works system-wide
  - Floating mic button (draggable overlay) - optional, always visible
- **Word corrections** - Custom dictionary to fix recurring recognition errors (e.g., "Tamtam" → "Tamdam")
- **Voice message transcription** - Share or open audio files (OPUS, AAC, OGG, M4A, MP3) to transcribe them
- **Multi-language** - Supports 25 languages with auto-detection
- **Material 3 UI** - Modern settings with dark/light theme support

### How It Works
1. User taps mic button (floating or accessibility)
2. Audio recorded at 16kHz PCM
3. Parakeet ONNX model transcribes speech locally
4. Word corrections applied (if configured)
5. Text injected into currently focused field via Accessibility API
6. Falls back to clipboard if no field focused

## Build

**Requirements:** OpenJDK 21, Android SDK platform 36, Python 3.11.8+, Gradle 8.12.1 (via wrapper)

**Build stack:** Kotlin 2.0.21, AGP 8.10.1, Compose compiler plugin (Kotlin 2.0+)

Current F-Droid/free Google Play preparation and signing steps are in
`docs/distribution/README.md`. Use that guide for the new Utterlane listing;
historical upstream publishing milestones below are not Utterlane approvals.

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Use absolute paths, not ~ (tilde doesn't expand in all contexts)
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/hatsch/Android/Sdk
export JAVA_HOME=/home/hatsch/android-studio/jbr
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# If signature mismatch error, uninstall first:
adb uninstall io.github.lrq3000.utterlane && adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Build Verification After Changes

Always run `./gradlew assembleDebug` after significant changes (localization, resource files, manifest edits). The F-Droid build only runs against tagged releases, so `fdroid build` is only needed before tagging a new version — not for every feature branch change.

**When to run F-Droid build:**
- Before tagging a new release (e.g., v1.0.3)
- After changing build config, NDK version, or sherpa-onnx srclib version
- NOT needed for resource-only changes on feature branches

**F-Droid build skips if APK exists:** once metadata for the new identity is submitted, fdroid checks `unsigned/io.github.lrq3000.utterlane_{versionCode}.apk`. Remove it to force a rebuild:
```bash
rm fdroiddata/unsigned/io.github.lrq3000.utterlane_3.apk
rm fdroiddata/unsigned/io.github.lrq3000.utterlane_3_src.tar.gz
```

### Gradle Daemon Issues
Stale Gradle daemons and corrupt cache cause `For input string: ""` errors. Clean before F-Droid builds:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.gradle/daemon
rm -rf /home/hatsch/claude/transcript/fdroiddata/build/io.github.lrq3000.utterlane/.gradle
```

### sherpa-onnx AAR
The sherpa-onnx JNI library and Kotlin bindings are built from pinned source and
placed at `app/libs/sherpa-onnx-<version>.aar`. ONNX Runtime 1.23.2 is an official,
SHA-256-verified MIT-licensed Maven Central dependency, not compiled by this tool.
Run `python tools/build_sherpa.py` on Windows or Linux; the Bash entry point is a
compatibility wrapper. The AAR location survives `gradle clean` for F-Droid builds.
Use `--sources-only` before F-Droid scanning, then `--build-only --gradle gradle`
after scanning, as specified in `docs/distribution/fdroid/`.

### NDK
F-Droid build requires NDK. The current Gradle build pins `28.2.13676358`;
any new F-Droid metadata must match it. The upstream metadata previously used
`27.0.12077973`. NDK versions available in the original build environment:
- `27.0.12077973`
- `28.2.13676358`

The NDK version must match between the fdroiddata YAML and the local SDK. `ANDROID_HOME` must be set for fdroid to find it.

### Common Build Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `For input string: ""` | Stale Gradle daemon cache | `rm -rf ~/.gradle/daemon` |
| `No app metadata found` | Running `fdroid build` from wrong directory | Must run from fdroiddata root, not the app repo |
| fdroid build skips silently | APK already exists in `unsigned/` | Remove existing APK and src tarball |
| `Environment variable {env: serverwebroot}` | Missing fdroid config (warning, not fatal) | Ignore — only needed for `fdroid publish` |
| Lint `MissingTranslation` | New string added to `values/strings.xml` without translations | Add to all `values-{locale}/strings.xml` files |

**Translations workflow:** When adding new strings, defer translations until the feature is complete and stable. This avoids repeatedly updating 23 locale files during iterative development. Add all translations in one batch before the release.
| Lint `ExtraTranslation` | String in translation file not in default `strings.xml` | Remove from translation files |
| XML apostrophe crash | Unescaped `'` in strings.xml | Use `\'` — e.g., `there\'s` not `there's` |

## Release Checklist

When bumping a version, update all of these:
1. `app/build.gradle.kts` — `versionCode` and `versionName`
2. `CHANGELOG.md` — Add new version entry with date
3. `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/{versionCode}.txt` — Short changelog for F-Droid/store
4. `github-release.md` — Release notes for GitHub releases (gitignored, copy manually)
5. Tag the release: `git tag v{versionName}`
6. Update fdroiddata YAML — see rules below

**fdroiddata YAML rules:**
- Only change version fields (`versionName`, `versionCode`, `commit`, `CurrentVersion`, `CurrentVersionCode`)
- Never modify build commands, paths, or formatting (e.g., keep trailing spaces on `cp ` line)
- Always ask before pushing to fdroiddata remote

**Git commits:**
- Never include `Co-Authored-By` in commit messages

## Architecture

### Core Components
| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `ParakeetRecognizer` | Offline speech recognition (sherpa-onnx, Parakeet v3 model ~600MB) |
| `FloatingMicService` | Draggable floating mic button overlay |
| `TextInjectionService` | Accessibility service for injecting text into focused fields |
| `DictionaryManager` | Post-processing word corrections/replacements |
| `SettingsActivity` | Jetpack Compose settings UI |

### Data Flow
```
Tap mic → AudioRecorder (16kHz PCM) → ParakeetRecognizer (ONNX)
    → DictionaryManager.applyReplacements() → TextInjectionService → Focused text field
```

## Recently Added: Dictionary/Word Corrections Feature

### What It Does
Post-processing text replacements after speech recognition. User defines rules like "Tamtam" → "Tamdam" and they're applied automatically.

### Files Added/Modified
- **NEW**: `asr/DictionaryManager.kt` - Stores rules in `replacements.json`, applies whole-word regex matching
- `UtterlaneApp.kt` - Added `dictionaryManager` instance
- `asr/RecognizerManager.kt` - Calls `applyReplacements()` after transcription
- `settings/SettingsRepository.kt` - Added `dictionaryEnabled` preference
- `settings/SettingsActivity.kt` - Added "Word Corrections" UI section with dialog

### Storage
Rules stored in `context.filesDir/replacements.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "rules": [
    {"from": "Tamtam", "to": "Tamdam", "caseSensitive": false}
  ]
}
```

### UI Location
Settings → Word Corrections → Manage Corrections

## Voice Message Transcription Feature

### What It Does
Transcribe voice messages from apps like WhatsApp, Signal, or any downloaded audio files. Supports OPUS, AAC, OGG, M4A, MP3 formats.

### Access Methods

**Implemented:**
1. **Share intent** - Share audio from WhatsApp/Signal → Utterlane appears in share sheet
2. **Open with** - Open audio files from file manager → Utterlane in app picker
3. **Folder monitoring** - Background service watches Downloads folder, shows notification when audio detected

**Future options (not yet implemented):**
- Quick Settings tile
- Home screen widget
- File picker button in Settings

### Architecture
```
TranscribeManager (extensible trigger system)
    ├── AudioMonitorService (folder watching trigger)
    └── [Future: QuickSettingsTile, Widget, etc.]

TranscribeActivity (UI for all access methods)
    ↓
AudioDecoder (MediaCodec → 16kHz mono PCM)
    ↓
RecognizerManager.transcribe() (reuses existing recognition)
```

### Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AudioDecoder.kt` | Decodes audio files using MediaExtractor/MediaCodec, resamples to 16kHz mono |
| `TranscribeActivity.kt` | Compose dialog for share/open/monitor intents, shows progress and result |
| `AudioMonitorService.kt` | Foreground service using FileObserver to watch Downloads folder |
| `TranscribeManager.kt` | Interface for adding new transcription triggers |

### Settings
- `audioMonitorEnabled` - Toggle folder monitoring
- `monitoredFolders` - Folders to watch (default: Downloads)

### UI Location
Settings → Voice Message Transcription → Monitor Downloads toggle

## Android 14+ Boot Restrictions

Android 14+ blocks starting foreground services with restricted types (`microphone`, `dataSync`) from `BOOT_COMPLETED`. The app handles this via:

1. **BootCompatHelper** — Checks `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE` (API 34)
2. **ServiceAlertNotification** — Shows persistent notification prompting user to open app
3. **SettingsActivity.onResume()** — Restarts services when user opens app

### FGS Type for AudioMonitorService

Uses `specialUse` instead of `dataSync` because:
- `dataSync` has 6-hour timeout on Android 15+ (targetSdk 35)
- `specialUse` has no time limit

**Google Play requirement:** When submitting, provide justification for `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE`:
> Monitors user-selected folders for voice messages to enable offline transcription. User-initiated, runs only while enabled in Settings.

**Manifest property:**
```xml
<property
    android:name="android.app.PROPERTY_SPECIAL_USE_FGS_SUBTYPE"
    android:value="Monitors user-selected folders for voice messages..."/>
```

## Hotwords Feature (BLOCKED)

Sherpa-onnx supports hotwords boosting but **NOT for Parakeet TDT models**:
- Requires `modified_beam_search` decoding (TDT models don't support it yet)
- Requires `bpe.vocab` file (not available for Parakeet v3)
- Monitor sherpa-onnx releases for TDT beam search support

When available, config would use:
```kotlin
OfflineRecognizerConfig(
    decodingMethod = "modified_beam_search",
    hotwordsFile = "/path/to/hotwords.txt",
    hotwordsScore = 2.0f
)
```

## Model Info
- **Model**: Parakeet TDT v3 (nemo_transducer)
- **Source**: `https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8`
- **Size**: ~600MB
- **Location**: `context.filesDir/parakeet-v3/`
- **Files**: encoder.onnx, decoder.onnx, joiner.onnx, tokens.txt

## Permissions Required
- RECORD_AUDIO
- SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW (floating button)
- FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE
- FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE (audio monitor — no timeout on Android 15+)
- BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS
- INTERNET (model download)
- READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (API < 33, audio monitor)
- READ_MEDIA_AUDIO (API >= 33, audio monitor)

## Package Info
- **Package and source namespace**: `io.github.lrq3000.utterlane`
- **App Class**: `UtterlaneApp.kt`
- **Main Activity**: `SettingsActivity.kt`

## Testing
1. Build and install (see Build section above)
2. Test floating mic: Enable in Settings → tap to transcribe
3. Test accessibility button: Enable in Android Settings → Accessibility → Utterlane
4. Test share: WhatsApp → share voice message → Utterlane appears in share sheet
5. Test open with: File manager → select audio → Open with Utterlane
6. Test folder monitoring: Enable in Settings → new audio in Downloads → auto-transcription
7. Test formats: OPUS, AAC, M4A, OGG, MP3

## Open Tasks

### F-Droid Publishing
- [ ] Create metadata for `io.github.lrq3000.utterlane` (no fdroiddata checkout is included here)
- [ ] Verify this new identity with `fdroid build` (upstream verification does not establish this)
- [x] Add app screenshots to `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/`
- [x] Create feature graphic at `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/featureGraphic.png`
- [ ] Submit to F-Droid via GitLab RFP at https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp
- [ ] Consider using git submodules instead of srclibs for external repos (sherpa-onnx) — submodules can be updated without an MR to fdroiddata and are covered by the scanner
- [ ] Enable [Reproducible Builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds) — allows users to switch between GitHub and F-Droid channels using the same signature
- [ ] Consider multiple APKs for native code — currently arm64-v8a only (36MB), could add armeabi-v7a/x86_64 as separate APKs

**Note:** F-Droid uses fast-forward merges. Always rebase the fdroiddata branch, never merge:
```bash
cd fdroiddata && git fetch origin master && git rebase origin/master && git push --force myfork add-utterlane
```
See [Git guide for fdroiddata contributors](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/wiki/-/wikis/Tips-for-fdroiddata-contributors/Git-Usage).

**F-Droid build order:** `prebuild` → scanner → `build` → gradle. The scanner runs between `prebuild` and `build`. Anything compiled in `prebuild` (like AAR files) will be flagged by the scanner as binary artifacts. Use `build:` instead of `prebuild:` for compiling native code from srclibs — this way the scanner never sees the built artifacts and `scanignore` is not needed. See `com.github.xiaoshihou.jiyi` and `de.schliweb.makeacopy` in fdroiddata for reference.

**Commit field:** F-Droid maintainers require full commit hashes (not tags or short hashes) in the `commit:` field. Example: `commit: f4d24b55fcf203c0a85f0030fb98e59f162d61fc` not `commit: v1.1.1`.

**Metadata descriptions:** Don't put `Description:` in the fdroiddata YAML. F-Droid pulls it automatically from `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/full_description.txt` in the source repo. About 53% of F-Droid apps use this approach.

**Git push:** Only use `--force` when history was actually rewritten (e.g., after rebase). A regular `git push` is sufficient for fast-forward updates.

**Local fdroid build:** Must run from fdroiddata root. Requires `ANDROID_HOME` for NDK:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.gradle/daemon
cd /home/hatsch/claude/transcript/fdroiddata
ANDROID_HOME=/home/hatsch/Android/Sdk fdroid build io.github.lrq3000.utterlane
```

**Testing unreleased commits (LOCAL ONLY — never commit this change):**
To test an F-Droid build before tagging a release, temporarily change `commit:` in the fdroiddata YAML to a branch name or commit hash:
```yaml
# Temporary — revert before committing!
commit: feature/localization   # or a specific commit hash
```
Then remove the existing APK from `unsigned/` and run `fdroid build`. Always revert the YAML change afterward.

### Google Play Publishing

The following checklist records upstream publishing work, not an Utterlane
listing. The new application ID requires its own listing and publishing setup.
- [x] Developer account created
- [x] App listing created with screenshots, descriptions, privacy policy
- [x] Accessibility service disclosure dialog added (required for permission approval)
- [x] 3 demo videos provided showing permission usage
- [x] Closed test release published (v1.0.2)
- [ ] Get 12 testers opted-in to closed test (required since late 2023 for new accounts)
- [ ] Run closed test for 14 days with 12+ testers
- [ ] Apply for production access and permission review

**Upstream status at handover:** On hold, with a closed-test release reported.
Check current Google Play requirements before publishing Utterlane; old testing
milestones and distribution claims do not transfer to the new application ID.

### Known Issues
- Vanadium browser doesn't handle voice input results (browser bug, not fixable on our side)
- AOSP keyboard has no voice input support (use HeliBoard instead)

### Localization
The user interface has been machine-translated into 23 languages. If you spot translation errors or awkward phrasing, please open a pull request.
