# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Incremental microphone and file transcription with bounded audio queues,
  recoverable completed text, and processing feedback.
- Optional local recording history, replay, export, and configurable retention.
- Moondream Parakeet Ultra/Redux recognition through the pinned CrispASR backend.
- F-Droid packaging preparation and free Google Play release-bundle workflow.
- GitHub Releases, Obtainium, and Komi Store installation instructions.

### Changed
- Rebrand the application, first-party source packages, JNI library, localized
  labels, release artifacts, and documentation as Utterlane.
- Use `io.github.lrq3000.utterlane` as the new Android application identity.
  This installs separately; upstream app data and permissions are not migrated.
- Apply the supplied Utterlane wordmark and icon to launcher, Settings,
  notifications, README and store artwork; archive the original design.
- Document maintenance by Stephen Karl Larroque, upstream lineage, and the
  policy welcoming AI contributions sanity checked by humans.
- Target Android 16 / API 36 while retaining Android 8 / ARM64 support.
- Build sherpa JNI and bindings with a portable Python tool; use the verified
  official ONNX Runtime 1.23.2 Maven artifact and check 16 KB native alignment.
- Publish release-signed APKs and Play bundles instead of debug APK releases.
- Refresh English Settings/transcription screenshots and clarify the optional
  accessibility service disclosure, with an in-app privacy-policy link.

### Fixed
- Preserve active transcription sessions across device sleep and allow completed
  audio to drain after capture stops.

Store publication is pending maintainer submission and store review. This entry
describes the prepared release, not an already available store listing.

Earlier entries and release links below belong to the upstream TranSlander
history and are retained as historical records.
